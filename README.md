# machine_learning
This is a collection of notes with introduction, examples, jupyter notebooks and codes to dive into the world of data science, assuming some prior knowledge in programming, python, and mathematics. 

The contents include
- Part 1: data analysis, feature engineering, supervised models
- Part 2: unsupervised models, model evaluation and tuning
- Part 3: topics on sklearn, spark 
- Part 4: project 1 - housing price prediction
- Part 5: project 2 - click-through-rate prediction
- Part 6: project 3 - p2p loan default rate

Below is a list of information I found very helpful to familiarize with the topics
- machine learning algorithms:
- kaggle kernels and discussions
- IBM data science specialization on coursera
