# machine_learning
This is a collection of notes with introduction, examples, and some interview tips for anyone interested in diving into the world of data science. I tried to pack it into a crash course under 60 days, assuming some prior knowledge in programming, python, and mathematics. 

The contents include
- Week 1: data analysis, feature engineering, supervised models
- Week 2: unsupervised models, model evaluation and tuning
- Week 3: topics on sklearn, spark 
- Week 4: project 1 - housing price prediction, project 1 - fraud prediction
- Week 5: project 2 - click-through-rate prediction
- Week 6: project 3 - p2p loan default rate
- Week 7: summary on interview faq, leetcode notes

Below is a list of information I found very helpful to familiarize with the topics
- machine learning algorithms:
- kaggle kernels and discussions
- IBM data science specialization on coursera:https://github.com/IBM/courser
