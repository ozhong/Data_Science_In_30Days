# machine_learning
This is a collection of notes with introduction, examples, jupyter notebooks and codes to dive into the world of data science, assuming some prior knowledge in programming, python, and mathematics. 

The contents include
- Part 1: data analysis, feature engineering, supervised models
- Part 2: unsupervised models, model evaluation and tuning
- Part 3: topics on sklearn, spark 
- Part 4: project 1 - housing price prediction
- Part 5: project 2 - click-through-rate prediction
- Part 6: project 3 - p2p loan default rate

Below is a list of information I found very helpful to familiarize with the topics
- machine learning algorithms:
- kaggle kernels and discussions
- IBM data science specialization on coursera

If the notebooks doesn't open properly, try below

A workaround
Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/index.ipynb") there and then you get "http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/index.ipynb"
This site nbviewer works independently of github.

If some notebook rendered in nbviewer appears different from rendered in github, then append "?flush_cache=true" to the end of the nbviewer version url to force it to rerender.
e.g.
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/index.ipynb
becomes
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/blob/master/index.ipynb?flush_cache=true
