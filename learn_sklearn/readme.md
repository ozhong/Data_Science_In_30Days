# Notes on sklearn

sklearn is a python library for building and testing machine learning models. 

The key modules include
- preprocessing: provides functionalities to handle missing value, redundant values, standardization, normalization,etc.
- models: classification and regression 
- model selection: functions to perform cross-validation, or calculate evaluation metrics.
- pipeline: an interface to combine processes for model training and testing

sklearn is well documented and has a lot of excellent examples.

The notebook in this folder summarizes most used functions for reference purpose.
